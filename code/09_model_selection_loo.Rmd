## read in data for model 

```{r}

## top code total number of reported contacts at 30 
top_code <- function(x) {
  x <- case_when(
    x > 30 ~ 30,
    TRUE ~ x

## topcode data.frame 
df_formodel_topcode <- df_formodel %>%
  mutate(across(c(starts_with("alter_age")), top_code))
```

Alternative model specifications with different time trends.
